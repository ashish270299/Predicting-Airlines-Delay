# Predicting-Airlines-Delay

• Built a regression predictive model that provides better insights to cut down delay time by 15 minutes

• Implemented quantitative analysis to discover patterns and data preparation using encoding and normalization

• Evaluated 4 machine learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, KNN Regression, Lasso Regression) to achieve 96.2% correct predictions

The dataset was taken from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suryanarayanan02/flight-delay-prediction-dataset
